There are two options available when installing Galasa. Prerequisites vary, depending on the option that is chosen. 

You can install Galasa for using in the command-line, or for sharing with your department (using the Galasa zipped distribution). If you do not have access to Maven Central, Eclipse Marketplace, and Docker Hub from your company network, use the Galasa zipped distribution. Otherwise, you can download the binary file for the Galasa CLI from the [Galasa cli repository](https://github.com/galasa-dev/cli/releases) in GitHub.  

You can then import the configuration into an IDE of your choice.


## Next steps
