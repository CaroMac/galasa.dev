There are a few options available for downloading and installing Galasa. Prerequisites vary, depending on the options that are chosen. 


## Download and Install options

You can download Galasa as a binary of the Galasa CLI tool from the GitHub `cli` repository, or as an Eclipse plug-in, which can be downloaded either directly from an external update site, or as a zip file (zipped distribution).  

The Galasa binary that is stored in the `cli` repository is installed by using the Galasa command line (Galasa CLI). The benefit of using the command-line to install Galasa is that much of the configuration set-up that is required is done for you automatically by scripts, so there is less manual intervention needed. You can then import the configuration into an IDE of your choice. 

If you are using only Eclipse for your IDE, you might choose to download the Galasa Eclipse plug-in directly from the external update site or as a zipped distribution. Users without restricted internet access who want to use open-source Galasa, can install the Galasa Eclipse plug-in directly. The zipped distribution of Galasa allows users who do not have access to Maven Central, Eclipse Marketplace and Docker Hub from their company network to use Galasa. 


## Next steps

Once you have decided on your download and install options, take a look at the [Prerequisites](../markdown-pages/docs/prerequisites) documentation to find out what software you need to install.

You can then choose to view either the [Getting started using the CLI](/docs/cli-command-reference/cli-command-reference) documentation or the [Getting started using Eclipse](/docs/getting-started) documentation.
