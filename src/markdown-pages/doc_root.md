There are two options available when downloading Galasa. Prerequisites vary, depending on the option that is chosen. 

You can download Galasa from the [Galasa cli repository](https://github.com/galasa-dev/cli/releases) in GitHub, or you can download the Galasa zipped distribution for sharing with your department. If you do not have access to Maven Central or Docker Hub from your company network, use the Galasa zipped distribution. Otherwise, download the binary file for the Galasa CLI from GitHub.  

You downloaded and installed Galasa, you can import the configuration into an IDE of your choice.
